            <h2>About Assab</h2>
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Assab, located along the Red Sea coast of Eritrea, is a vital port city known for its strategic location near the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, a crucial maritime chokepoint linking the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. Founded as a trading outpost, Assab has long been a center for regional trade and cultural exchange. Its deep-water port was developed significantly during Italian colonial rule in the late 19th century, positioning Assab as a major hub for shipping and commerce in the Horn of Africa.

                    Today, Assab’s economy relies primarily on its port facilities, which handle cargo bound for various East African nations. The city also hosts an oil refinery and has potential as a free trade zone. Known for its arid climate, Assab offers visitors unique coastal landscapes and insights into Eritrea's multicultural heritage, while its port remains central to Eritrea’s trade ambitions and development strategy.</p>
